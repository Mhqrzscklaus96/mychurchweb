      <h1>Our Statement of Faith</h1>
      <p>This is the statement of the Bible doctrine as believed and taught by Amazing Fire and Miracles Ministries </p> <br>
      <p>This statement of faith has its source in the Bible and is in total agreement with the principles of the doctrines of Christ. We believe that the Bible contains the inspired and infallible Word of God. (2 Timothy 3:16, 2 Peter 1: 20-21)</p>
      <br>
      <p>We believe that there is only one God eternally existent in three persons; God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Ghost. (Ephesians 4:5-6, Gen. 1:26, Matthew 3:16-17).</p> <br>
      <p>We believe in the deity of Christ. (John 1: 1-4; John 10:30; Hebrews 1:1-5). <br>
        a. He was born of a virgin (Matthew 1:18-25; Luke 1:30-35) <br>
        b. He was conceived of the Holy Ghost (Matthew 1:18-25, Luke 1:30-35) <br>
        c. He died (John 19:30-35) <br>
        d. He rose again from the dead bodily (John 20:25-29, Luke 24:36-40) <br>
        e. He ascended into heaven bodily (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17; Matthew 29-30)
        </p> <br>
        <p>We believe in the rapture of the church and the Second coming of Christ.
            (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17; Matthew 29-30</p> <br>

        <p>We believe regeneration by the power of the Holy Spirit through the Word of God is essential for personal salvation (Titus 2:5, John 3:3-5, Ephesians 5:25-27)</p> <br>
        <p>We believe in the final resurrection of both the saved and the lost; the former to eternal life and the latter to eternal judgement. (Revelations 20: 11 -15; 1 Corinthians 15: 12 â€“ 23)</p>
